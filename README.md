# MTH325-Hakimi-Havel-Validation-and-Contruction
This is a program I made that takes in a degree sequence and runs the [Hakimi-Havel Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havel%E2%80%93Hakimi_algorithm) to validate and recontruct a possible graph. Construction uses the history that is saved from the validation step and is done recursively.

## Run Instructions
Open up your favorite python terminal and edit the value for `degree_sequence` in the `main.py` file. Run the program and watch the program create edge sets, vertex sets, and a fancy graph to represent the data.
